# Project Name: Merlin Flight Management System

## Introduction:

A Flight Management System (FMS) consists of a computer and a control display unit. The FMS computes all necessary flight elements using navigation and performance databases, along with pilot-provided data. Pilots interface with one to three Multipurpose Control and Display Units (MCDU), and Merlin now offers Touch Control and Display Units (TCDUs) for added convenience. The FMS reduces pilot workload, with ongoing research in new technologies like 4D trajectories and future air navigation systems.

## Justification:

1. Designed to support commercial and military fleets, excluding old war aircraft.
2. Reduces time and cost for developing, implementing, and testing new functionality.
3. Continuously developed to meet current and future airspace management standards.
4. Creates optimized flight paths, 4D Trajectories, lowers sound intrusion, emissions, and fuel consumption.
5. Maximizes Human and Cargo Safety, minimizing cockpit workload.
6. Modular design and flexible capabilities allow quick response to unique operator requests.
7. Enables future work with data management and analytics.
8. Offers an easy solution with software components for implementation across various aircraft programs.
9. Research and Development (R&D) lowers the cost of acquiring new functionalities.
10. Flexibility enhanced with Touch Control Display Units (TCDU) for easy implementation.
11. Advanced FMS ensures safety systems, providing confidence and secured investment for global investors.

## Use Cases

### Flight Planning System (Use Case 1):

- Pilots use Merlin Flight Service 1800wxbrief to submit and update flight plans.
- Verification processes ensure pilot eligibility, with AOC and ATC confirming plan validity.
- VFR plans can be submitted mid-flight via radio communication.
- Pilots cancel VFR plans before safe landing, confirming with Flight Service Station Operators.

### Flight Network Management (Use Case 2):

- Ensures safe travel by coordinating flight plans, ground control, and sector transitions.
- Network management officers review and approve flight plans.
- Ground control guides planes across the apron and runway.
- Terminal control handles complex airspace.

### Air Traffic Control Management (Use Case 3):

- Controllers guide planes from entry to exit points, maintaining safe separation.
- Adherence to rules, avoiding mid-air collisions, and handovers between sectors.

### Flight Handling System (Use Case 4):

- Airport network managers ensure sufficient air traffic controllers.
- Delays communicated to airlines, decisions made for delays or alternative routes.

### Flight Survey System (Use Case 5):

- Merlin Aerial Survey offers customized aerial mapping and survey solutions.
- Clients request specific surveys.
- Pilots submit flight plans, engineers adjust camera settings, and surveys are conducted.

### FMC of FMS Troubleshooting (Use Case 6):

- Technicians troubleshoot FMC issues, distinguishing hardware and software faults.
- BITE functionality aids in analyzing aircraft performance.
- Fault logs created for detailed analysis or repairs.
